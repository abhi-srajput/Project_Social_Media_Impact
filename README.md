Social Media Impact Analysis

This project explores how social media usage affects studentsâ€™ academic performance, mental health, and sleep patterns. Using survey data, we analyze usage patterns, identify risk levels, and visualize key trends.

Features

Data cleaning & exploration

Feature engineering (risk level, sleep quality, academic index)

Visualizations of platform usage and impact

Key findings on high usage and academic/sleep risks

Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

ðŸ”‘ Key Findings

Instagram and TikTok dominate student preferences, accounting for over 60% of usage.

Higher daily usage correlates with lower sleep quality and increased academic risk.

Clear patterns of risk segmentation (Low, Moderate, High) based on usage intensity and addiction scores.

Students with balanced usage patterns exhibit better academic and mental well-being.
