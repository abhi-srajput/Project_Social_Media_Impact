🔑 Key Findings

Instagram and TikTok dominate student preferences, accounting for over 60% of usage.

Higher daily usage correlates with lower sleep quality and increased academic risk.

Clear patterns of risk segmentation (Low, Moderate, High) based on usage intensity and addiction scores.

Students with balanced usage patterns exhibit better academic and mental well-being.
